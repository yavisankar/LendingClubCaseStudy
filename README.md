# Problem Statement
Consumer Finance Company which specialises lending various types of loans to Urban customers. Finance Company receives a loan applications from the customers. Based on the Customer past records and parameters, company has to take a decision whether to approve the loan or reject the loan.

Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

1.If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
2.If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

# Business Objectives
This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 
Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 
If one is able to identify these risky loan applicants, then such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
In other words, the company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment

## Conclusions
1. Most of the loans are issued in 2011 year.
2. There is a raise of loan issuance from Jan to Dec. Most issuance of loans are in Dec Month
3. If term of loan is higher (60) then there might be case where customers will get defaulters.
4. If interest rate, loan amount is high then customers will be pron to defaulters.
5. If revol utilization is high then customers will be pron to defaulters.
6. Who ever done more Enquires in last 6 months, then the loan will get to defaulter.
7. If there are more recovories then the loan will get to defaulter.
